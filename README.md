All crafted tools are enchanted with efficiency III.

### Scenario Manager
This scenario requires the scenario manager be installed on the server as well, it can be found [here][Scenario Manager]. If you are not already using it, I would recommend that you check it out because it isn't just another scenario manager, has some pretty cool features such *supporting multiple languages including Kotlin, Java, and Skript*.

### Installation
Before you can install the scenario, you must install the scenario manager found [here][Scenario Manager]. Then, you can download the latest build of this scenario [here][Latest Stable Artifact]. Once you have it installed just place it in the plugins folder of your server.
